        <h3>Domain names and ICANN</h3>
        <p class="lead">Domain names:
            Domain name is the address of your website that people type in the browser URL bar to visit your website.
            When you enter a domain name in your web browser, it first sends a request to a global network of servers
            that form the Domain Name System (DNS). These servers then look up for the name servers associated with the
            domain and forward the request to those name servers. The server may have that address stored locally or may
            need to request that information from another server.

        <p class="lead">ICANN:
            ICANN:
            To reach another person on the Internet you have to type an address into your computer - a name or a number.
            That address has to be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN coordinates these unique
            identifiers across the world. Without that coordination we wouldn't have one global Internet.
            ICANN was formed in 1998. It is a not-for-profit partnership of people from all over the world dedicated to
            keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It promotes competition and develops policy on the
            Internet’s unique identifiers.
            ICANN doesn’t control content on the Internet. It cannot stop spam and it doesn’t deal with access to the
            Internet. But through its coordination role of the Internet’s naming system, it does have an important
            impact on the expansion and evolution of the Internet.
